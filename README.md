# parallax-mapping
Parallax mapping demonstration, comparison with normal mapping. C++/OpenGL,GLSL

Use left/middle mouse buttons to adjust the camera position. Use LShift+left mouse button for moving the light source.


# Description
This program is a demonstration of parallax mapping. Parallax mapping is a rendering technique giving the illusion of complex geometry at an acceptable cost.

Visually, the result is better than plain normal mapping but not as good as actual displacement mapping.

Below are screenshots illustrating the result of this technique. In the scene the geometry is a simple plane made of 4 vertices. Notice the dramatic improvement this technique provides compared to normal mapping.
